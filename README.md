# interlayer-bonded-trilayer-graphene
#### repo for interlayer bonded trilayer graphene

---

## files and folders

1. /src = source code

2. /example = example samples of RD-ITG

3. /dependencies = required dependencies for source codes

4. /H-chemisorption maps = H-chemisorbed RD-ITG maps showing only H passivating agents around C atoms participating in interlayer bonds

5. /int-bond maps = interlayer-bonded C maps showing sp^3^-hybridized C atoms (different color means different z position)

P.S. placeholders will be removed when codes are pushed from local machine!
